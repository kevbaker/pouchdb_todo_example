# Pouchdb Todo Example


## Overview

This is an example Todo application that uses PouchDB and CouchDB for local and remote persistence through PouchDb replication.

## Dependencies

All dependencies for this example are loaded through a CDN.

For remote replication to work properly with this example you will need to install a local copy of
[PouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org) and configure security as described
in the [CouchDB security and PouchDB authentication](http://www.mircozeiss.com/couchdb-security-and-pouchdb-authentication/) article.

If you would like to test remote replication uncomment the "replication" lines in the source code at the bottom of this file.
